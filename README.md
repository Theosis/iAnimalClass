# iAnimalClass
Animal Class with an Interface

Modified the Animal class example to include an interface.

An interface allows you to define a "contract" that says this implementing class must include these methods but leaves the end programmer the flexibility to decide how to implement the methods....

Modify your Animal class to include an Interface -OR- use an interface in the Car class application.

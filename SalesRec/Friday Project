Create a Java console application that allows the user a sales record. 

Each sales record includes: 
customer number, name, sales amount and a tax code.

The program should loop to enter as many records as the user wishes. 
Prompt the user to enter another record or quit.

PLAN FIRST! Before you write your program, 
determine the inputs, processing steps and outputs.  
Enter them and the pseudocode for the program in the text box, 
then create the program and submit it through gitHub.

tax code		tax amount
NRM					6%
NPF					0%
BIZ					4.5%
The program should output a total that includes the tax owed (if any).

Customer ID: 101
Customer Name: Bart Simpson
Sales Amount: $500.00
Tax Code: NPF
Total Amount Due: $500.00

Do you want to enter another record? (Y/N)
_____________________________________________________________________

INPUT: 		Get user to enter custNum, custName, salesAmt, taxCode
OUTPUT:	Display totalAmt incl. corresp.tax. 	
PROCESS : Calculate tax according to supplied table, add it to salesAmt.

Pseudocode

PRINT "CREATION OF SALES RECORDS"
PRINT "Enter requested field values."

DOWHILE another="Y"

	DOWHILE invalidTax
		LET invalidTax=false
		INPUT "Tax Code: ", taxCode
		CONVERT taxCode to upper case
		IF taxCode is NRM, tax=6 ELSE IF taxCode is BIZ, tax=4.5 ELSE IF taxCode is NPF, tax=0 ELSE invalidTax=true
	WHILEEND
	
	LET totalAmt= salesAmt*(1+tax/100)
	PRINT "Total Amount Due: ", totalAmt as $
	PRINT
	DOWHILE another isn't Y/N
		INPUT "Do you want to enter another record? (Y/N) ", another
		CONVERT another to upper case
	WHILEEND	
	PRINT
